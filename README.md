YOLOv8 Object Detection with ESP32-CAM Streaming
Overview
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model with images streamed from an ESP32-CAM. The Python script captures images from an ESP32-CAM, detects objects such as cats and birds, and displays annotated results.

Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Uses YOLOv8 to detect and annotate objects.
ESP32-CAM Integration: Streams images from an ESP32-CAM over WiFi.
Resolution Options: Supports different image resolutions (low, medium, high) from the ESP32-CAM.

Requirements
Python Script
Python 3.x
opencv-python library
numpy library
ultralytics library (for YOLOv8)
Install the required libraries using pip:pip install opencv-python numpy ultralytics

ESP32-CAM Setup
ESP32-CAM module

see in the docs


Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
WiFi network credentials
Setup
ESP32-CAM Code
Install the Required Libraries:

Ensure you have the esp32cam and WebServer libraries installed in your Arduino IDE.

Upload the Code:
Open the Arduino IDE, paste the ESP32-CAM code into a new sketch, and upload it to your ESP32-CAM.

Connect to WiFi:
Replace WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASS with your WiFi credentials in the ESP32-CAM code.

Obtain the IP Address:
After uploading, open the Serial Monitor to see the ESP32-CAMâ€™s IP address.
Python Script
Configure the URL:
Replace url in the Python script with the IP address of your ESP32-CAM and the path to the image (e.g., 'http://<ESP32-IP>/cam-hi.jpg').
Run the Script:

Execute the Python script to start capturing and processing images from the ESP32-CAM.
View the Output:
The script will open a window displaying the image with detected objects. Press 'q' to quit the window.
Code Overview
Python Script
Model Initialization: Loads the YOLOv8 model for object detection.
Image Handling: Fetches images from the ESP32-CAM URL.
Object Detection: Processes images to detect and annotate objects (e.g., cats, birds).
Display: Shows the annotated images in a window.
ESP32-CAM Code
Camera Setup: Initializes the ESP32-CAM with different resolutions.
Web Server: Sets up a web server to stream JPEG images at different resolutions.
Endpoint Handlers: Handles requests to serve images at different resolutions.
